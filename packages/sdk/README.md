Building on the open-source magic of the Suiwallet SDK, various wallets, and Suietkit, weâ€™ve brought together the latest active wallets and exchange wallets on Sui into one open-source codebase! ðŸŽ‰ And guess what? Weâ€™re keeping it fresh with continuous updates. ðŸš€  

We hope this becomes a handy tool for Hydropower and all our amazing partners building on Sui. Huge shoutout to the incredible open-source culture of Sui for making this possible. ðŸ’™ Let's keep building together! âœ¨
