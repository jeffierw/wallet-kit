Nemo wallet kit is an awesome react toolkit for DApps to interact with all the wallets in Sui💧 easily 🥳

Now we announce the **[Sui Wallet Standard](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/wallet-adapter/wallet-standard)** is supported ✅ Update to the latest kit version and empower your dapp with auto-detect-wallet feature 🥳 

> ⭐️ That means with our kit, your dapp can automatically detect all the installed wallets which implement wallet-standard in users' browser, rather than manually importing specific wallet adapter.

We present **React Provider & Hooks, UI components** for the DApp (React) developers to connect your DApp and all the wallet extensions 🔗 Integration solution or customization are both supported ✅
